# Rust10x VSCode Extension

Rust10x is designed to enhance productivity in production coding with Rust.

For more information and keybindings, visit: https://rust10x.com/vscode

The initial release includes a collection of snippets that I frequently use in my daily Rust programming and in my [Rust Production Coding Videos](https://youtube.com/jeremychone).

All snippets are prefixed with `10x-`, making them quick to select by just typing `1` and then triggering the suggestion. For example, typing `1tf` and then pressing `Ctrl+Space` will suggest `10x-test-fn`, `10x-test-async-fn`, and `10x-impl-try-from`. ([more info](https://rust10x.com/vscode))

I haven't included keybindings as they are quite personal, but you can find the ones I use at [rust10x/vscode](https://rust10x.com/vscode).

More coming...

Happy Coding!
